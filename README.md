# Purpose

This is a demonstration application.

The idea is to simulate a company, "Monitor Magic", that
provides remote sensor monitoring and checklist services
to the food industry.

# Technical Concepts Illustrated

We'll explore fast and efficient ways to:

- Regenerate seed data for a hierarchy of thousands of restaurants
- Store and search upon reasonably large datasets of sensor data and checklists
- Provide performant realtime dashboards
- Propagate changes through a hierarchy of checklists
